This is an accessory clamp for a 1.75" bar.
There are holes for bosses which you will need to use heatset inserts.  These can typically be ordered on ebay or in bulk from McMaster Carr (https://www.mcmaster.com/heat-set-inserts/).  You don't have to populate all of the accessory holes; only the sizes you need, however you will need 4 M3 inserts to join the two halves.


Required:
* Qty 4: 94180A331 M3 3.8mm depth
* Qty 4: M3x16mm screw


Depending on the accessories you wish to mount, you can use a combination of the below:
* 94180A331 M3 3.8mm depth (for the top/side)
* 93365A160	1/4"-20 .3" depth (for the top/side)
* 93365A162	1/4"-20 .5" depth (for the front)


You can not use 1/4"-20 .5" on the top/side as the holes are not deep enough and would be an interference fit.
